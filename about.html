        Jiu Jitsu techniques while conserving the traditions and values of the

        Our classes are run by a Senior Instructor and 6th Degree (Dan) Black
        Belt, O Sensei Michael CIWAWA and the Assistant Instructor Sensei
        Raphael.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognise the importance of our student`s safety and prioritise
        safety practices. Our instructors are also internationally accredited
        and all possess valid certificates for First Aid Training and Police
        Clearance. We have been operating within the safe facilities of the St
        Francis Of Assisi Catholic Church of Yeoville.
      </p>
      <p>
        While running group classes, our teaching approach considers each child
        as a single individual with specific learning requirements and needs;
        therefore, our instructors pay a close attention to each child`s
        development.

          learning provides the best learning experience. Discipline development
          does not have to be boring.
        </li>
        <li>
          LIFE SKILLS: As instructors, we can agree that we have a certain
          degree of responsibility and influence over a child's mental/emotional
          development, therefore use this privilege to cultivate life skills
          such as goals-setting, discipline, self-discipline, courage, focus,
          perseverance, respect, loyalty, self-control confidence and positive
          attitude.
        </li>
        <li>
          PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT: Children in a modern society grow up into a very
          sedentary lifestyle. We believe that kids and adults need to remain
          physically active daily. We are constantly encouraging and assisting
          students to improve their fitness levels. We recognise that not all
          our students will or even want to become black belts graduates and
          we're okay with that while they are under our care. We are committed
          to assist parents by instilling the skills children will need to
          handle what life throws at them. We hope to have a very positive
          influence in our/your children's lives.
